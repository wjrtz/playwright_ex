## Contributing

To run the tests locally, you'll need to:

1. Check out the repo
2. Run `mix setup`. This will take care of setting up your dependencies, installing the JavaScript dependencies (including Playwright), and compiling the assets.
3. Run `mix test` or, for a more thorough check that matches what we test in CI, run `mix check`
